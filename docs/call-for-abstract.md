We solicit the submission of extended abstracts up to 2 pages (excluding references and supplementary material). This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on how to design Human-Robot systems that balance autonomy and user control, with a particular focus on preserving and enhancing the user's sense of agency. 
We welcome contributions addressing (but not limited to) the following topics: <br> 

<ul style="margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Neuroscientific foundations</span> of agency, embodiment, and ownership.</li>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Frameworks</span> of shared autonomy in Human-Robot Interaction.</li>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Experimental studies</span> on the impact of shared control on agency and behavior.</li>
    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Sensory feedback</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">multimodal communication</span> to support intuitive interaction.</li>
</ul>

This is an opportunity to share ongoing or completed research and engage in rich discussions with experts from robotics, neuroscience, psychology, and human-computer interaction. <br> 
All accepted contributions will be presented in interactive poster sessions. Posters should clearly communicate the main ideas, methods, and findings, and will serve as a basis for interactive discussion. <br>

Submission Guidelines: <br>
<ul style="margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li> Abstracts should be max <span style="font-weight: bold">2 page</span>, excluding references and supplementary material.</li>
    <li> Please submit in <span style="font-weight: bold">PDF format</span> via <span style="font-weight: bold">TBD</span>.</li>
</ul>

In addition, authors of accepted abstracts will be asked to register and submit a 3-minute spotlight video. These videos will be available on the workshop website and LinkedIn page prior to the event to engage participants, and will be streamed during the coffee break sessions. These short videos are intended to spark curiosity and encourage in-depth discussions during the poster sessions. <br>
